# weather-app

Displays weather in a given city, built using the Vue.js framework.

## Running Locally

To run locally, you'll first need to sign up for a token [from here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Then insert your token into the `App.vue` file at this point:

```js
apiKey: "token_here",
```

Then find your closest terminal window and type

```sh
npm run serve
```

Then navigate to `localhost:3000` and search for a city!
